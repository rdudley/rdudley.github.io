	<p class="work-title">Coca-Cola</p>
	<p>Coca-Cola is a client we build tools for. Lots of tools. For me it was a chance to work on projects using Apache Cordova and TideSDK, and to build a custom CMS to showcase all of the other tools that have been created. I've also worked on web applications to manage XFDF(XML) data submitted during internal surveys, storing the data and raw files, parsing, then providing custom analytics as needed. A good challenge and learning experience with a super tight deadline and 30,000+ submissions!</p>
