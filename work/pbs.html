	<p class="work-title">PBS</p>
	<p>It has been a great pleasure to work with PBS over the years. I've worked on well over a hundred different DVD and Blu-ray titles, with my favorites being the work of Ken Burns including The National Parks, The War, Jazz, and The Civil War. For a developer these projects have a been a great creative outlet, and it is always very interesting to work with the source images and footage provided by the producers, to learn about the subject, and collaborate with other designers. Larger titles also included motion menus created using Adobe After Effects.</p>
	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	<p>Outside of the DVD and Blu-ray projects, I've worked on a number of supplmental websites for DVD and Blu-ray titles, and newsletter/survey web applications.</p>
