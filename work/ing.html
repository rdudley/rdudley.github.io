	<p class="work-title">ING</p>
	<p>I've worked on a number of small microsites for ING over the years with the most recent being a small microsite about ING's new identity, Voya Financial. The site was a small Drupal site, and I worked with both contract devs and the designers at Planet. Cloud offerings at Rackspace were used to handle any load issues, and the site configuration took advantage of cloud load balancers, servers, databases, with an extra bit of caching to keep things running smoothly.</p>
	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	<p>I also help maintain their orangelaces.com site, keeping both content and CMS current and fully backed up.</p>
