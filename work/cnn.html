	<p>I was tasked to work on a number of RSVP web applications for CNN events that were used in conjuction with email campaigns being sent via Campaign Monitor and Mailchimp. The projects were straightforward and simple, but very helpful to the client and kept the task of managing reservations an easy one. I also worked on a sweepstakes site CNN sponsored for the feature film Nine. The site featured a custom video player with event tracking, a flash based "what character am I?" game and a sweepstakes with data export.</p>
