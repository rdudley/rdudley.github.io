	<p>In the glory days of Flash heavy websites and banners I was able to work with SNI on a number of fun projects. The banners all featured custom video players, a full suite of custom and Omniture event tracking, XML for configuration and content, and dynamic part loading to keep the initial load under 40kb. This was quite a challenge at times, and I learned more than I thought I knew about image compression and code optimization.</p>
	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	<p>In addition to the banners, I worked with the designers at Planet on many sweepstakes and special product websites. These sites were integrated into SNI's CMS, and had to adhere to the standards SNI had in place and fully validate with their application environment. As I love to cook, the Iron Chef and Chef Jeff sweeps were good fun to work on.<p>
